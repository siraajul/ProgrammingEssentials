# ProgrammingEssentials

Welcome to ProgrammingEssentials, your comprehensive guide to mastering core programming fundamentals through 150
carefully curated coding challenges!

## 🚀 Overview

ProgrammingEssentials is designed to build a strong foundation in essential programming concepts. Perfect for absolute
beginners, this course focuses on the building blocks of coding that are crucial across all programming languages.

## 🏗️ Structure

The Repo is divided into three sprints, each focusing on progressively more advanced fundamental concepts:

1. **Basic Sprint**: 50 problems
2. **Intermediate Sprint**: 50 problems
3. **Advanced Sprint**: 50 problems

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Curated Problems**: Each problem is carefully selected to reinforce specific fundamental programming concepts.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Problems gradually increase in complexity while staying focused on core concepts.
- **Language Agnostic**: Concepts taught are applicable across various programming languages.
- **Practical Approach**: Emphasis on hands-on coding to solidify understanding of fundamentals.

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- Complete beginners starting their programming journey
- Self-taught programmers looking to strengthen their grasp of fundamentals
- Anyone wanting to ensure they have a solid foundation in core programming concepts
